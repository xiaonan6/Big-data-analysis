# Big-data-analysis
This is a school project on movie success prediction.

Throught the project, 26,000,000 reviews were extracted and cleaned from 270,000+ users on 45,000 movies from TMDB open API and GroupLens. Exploratory data analysis and rich visualizations were utilized to explore the relationship between features and response variable. Machine learning pipelines were built with feature encoding, Word2Vec feature engineering, and gradient boosting machines. Moviesâ€™ successfulness were predicted using metrics raw profit, ROI, and rating. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support investment decisions.
